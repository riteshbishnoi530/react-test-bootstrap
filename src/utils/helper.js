    "Given our best in class offering, we need to cut through by opting for penetration pricing.",
    "This will allow us to disrupt an established market by introducing our product and service at a lower price to entice new customers to purchase or subscribe. This strategy will help us capture the attention of this very large audience in need of a good solution.",

    "As well as being the cheapest in market, our product offers everything a sole trader needs in one place, whilst pricing innovation of zero commission rather than a commission, will drive customers that are particularly price sensitive."
